## About This Project
 
 This project is a web application that represents Covid 19 world wide statistics. It includes 4 major
 components:
 - An interactive worldwide map that contains information on each country.
 - A per country dashboard that shows relevant statistics about the status of Covid-19 in the country. 
 - A simulations section that demonstrates the theoretical impact of certain measures on mitigating infectious
 disease spread.
 - A searchable table for worldwide statistics.

 I started working on this in March 2019, when my university just shutdown
 due to the first cases of Covid-19 in Canada. My plan was to create a comprehensive worldwide tracker
 for cases using an interactive map. In early May I was ready to publish a version of this project that
 included everything but the simulations. However, by that time there had been already tons of other trackers
 that have been developed and published, many with significantly higher quality than mine. In some sense, 
 I felt that my project was useless because it offered nothing new, so I decided to add a simulation section
 to offer something new with my website at the time. I saw that a lot of informational Covid-19 websites
 do mention the importance of certain measures at mitigating disease spread, but none really (at least from
 what I came across at the time) provided a visual explanation of why these measures work so well.
 Even though I developed the simulations, I was very surprised with how revealing the results were and it 
 certainly made me more meticulous with the preventative measures I took towards the pandemic. 

 The site gained a few thousand views and reached a bunch of countries around the world according to my 
 Google Analytics dashboard. I had a few hunder reoccuring visitors, so it made me happy to know that 
 I provided useful information to someone around the world. After a year when traffic really dwindeled,
 I decided to stop paying for the original domain, however the project is still hosted on Heroku. 


## Technology behind the Website:

Developing this had a bit of a learning curve for me to learn new technologies and also website design.
Here is the tech stack for the website:

- React for the frontend 
- Django for the backend API
- D3 for visualizations
- Semantic UI as a component library
- Python to develop the simulations
- Heroku for Deployment

I was already familiar with React, Django, and Heroku Deployment when I started this project.
D3 was the most time-consuming/difficult to learn. What I wanted to do with my map visualization
was really specific so there was not a ton of examples to build off of. It involved a lot of geometry and
projection calculations so it was a lot of time spent to get the right numbers. 

Another difficult technicality I had to deal with was combining the Django API and my React front end in one bundled
application. Ideally I would have hosted the API separate from the frontend and just whitelist my frontend domain. However,
I did not want to pay for two Heroku deployments. What I did is that I redirected my Django root index file to be the same
as the React index file. I also had to point Django to the React build files, and change the location of the React build
directory so Django can read it.

Design was also hard. Even tough I was using a component library, I found design to be really difficult to make
things look professional and visually appealing. I still think the published website design was not great, but 
it was good enough given the time I had to finish it.

Finally, the simulations were a ton of work. However, that on its own was a project, so I'll leave the details
for that out of this post.


## Takeaways and Mistakes:

I considered this project as my first major intentional Open Source contribution. I had good intentions of wanting
to provide useful information to people as well as open sourcing my code, but my execution was a bit naive which 
really reduced the potential impact of my work. I should not have worked on something like this alone. I was 
way too slow to publish this and also working alone probably slowed down my learning rate by a lot. If I were 
to do this again now, I would try to find an existing open source project or group up with a bunch of developers who
have the same goals in mind to build something like this. 

The project was a great learning opporunity and it felt great to see some interaction from different communities with 
my website. 

### Some Technical Takeaways:

- I didn't really know about bundle optimization at the time. I added too many assets in my source files
and it really bloated up the final size of my website. I good time trying to figure out why Heroku was
not accepting my 500mb deployment while I had my animation videos included in the source files. Not 
my brightest moment. 
- Combining React and Django under one app saved me money but it was a lot of development pain. It was my first
time working with webpack and it was such an unecessary modification given how much time it took me to setup. 
It also made the deployment more complicated and also contributed to making my deployed site very large. 
- Since I used React, my content was loaded through client side rendering which probably
significantly impacted my SEO. I should have used server side rendering or static rendering (with interval updates) 
for the website since the data only updated a few times a day.
- I really underestimated the importance of design in making important information look presentable. I tried 
to learn some design skills but it was not nearly enough to make things look as good as I wanted them to be. 
- I had some code formatting plugins to help my code looking clean but I did not have any code quality 
plugins (eg. Eslint) so I have a lot of full on tortellini code in a bunch of places in my repo. My 
code quality was not great at all and it made it really annoying to make edits after sometime. 



## Status of this Project

I have sunsetted this project after site traffic really decreased after a year or so. I still have the website
hosted on Heroku and the repository on my website. The state of the code is really dire and I do not plan to
maintain it moving forward. There are some useful pieces of code that I might refactor for later projects
such as the map visualizations, the dashboard, and the search functionality.
