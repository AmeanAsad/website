## About This Project
 
 This project was an accompanying open source module that I made to generate
 the simulations that were on my Covid-19 tracking website. 

 At first I was interested in seeing how I can test the effectiveness of various
 measures against mitigating disease spread. I watched Steve Brunton's series on 
 simple mathematical modelling of disease spread and I started writing some code
 to get some results. I wrote a module that basically simulates a bunch of nodes
 that move randomly inside a confined space. I assigned values to speed of movement
 , probability of infection, radius of infection, etc. that I tried my best to estimate
 from doing some research. The program then simulates disease spread until all nodes 
 contact the disease. Obviously, this is a very simple model of disease spread, but I
 intended for this module to be something small and very easy to use to produce some 
 meaningful simulations.
