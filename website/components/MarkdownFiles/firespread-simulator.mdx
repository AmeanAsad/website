## About the Project:

I developed this module to simulate wildfire spread as a helper tool for one of the projects
I worked on during university. The project involved using Lloyd's deployment algorithm to optimize
how a bunch of drones can optimally fight a wildfire. In order to test if our algorithm works or not 
we had to find some way of simulating a fire. Finding an existing real wildfire progression data and
loading it proved a difficult task. Even then, we would have to find numerous datasets that test
our algorithm in various fire spreads. Therefore, I decided to write this module to stochastically
model fire spread, allowing us to test the algorithm in very randomized scenarios. 

## Technical Information:

I developed the module in Python. The fire spread is based on cellular automaton concepts. The 
area of spread is defined as a matrix. Then a few overlapping matrices are defined to indicate
each cell's vegetation, moisture levels, and population density. These factors impact the intensity
of the fire in different areas as it spreads, creating more parameters for our algorithm to optimize
where to fight the fire from. I also added wind speed as a parameter as well, which adds another layer
of randomness for the fire spread.
