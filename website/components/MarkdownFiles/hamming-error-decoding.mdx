## About this Project:

In my second year of university, I took an Algebraic Structures course taught by Professor
Fady Alajaji. The course went over various Number Theory and Group Theory topics and 
showed their application in Error Correction. In the course we were taught about Hamming
Error Correction and also error correction using Syndrome Error Decoding. For those curious,
Syndrome Error Decoding is pillar of developing Golay Codes which were an instrumental
part of NASA's Voyager spacecraft communication systems. 

I was really interested in syndrome error decoding, so I decided to write a program
that does error correction on text data. My research showed that there no general
Python libraries that developed a general (n, k) linear code. Most of the code examples
I found implemented parity bit checking of a specific sized linear or were just
manual implementations of a Golay code.

I developed an open source module that automatically generates any (n,k) linear code. This includes
automatically generating a generator matrix, a syndrom error decoding table along with 
functions to encode and decode information. 

Accompanied with my module is an example of its application of ASCII text by converting
the ASCII text to fixed length binary codes. 

## Status of Project:

I have not really revisited the module since I created the working code. Recently  I took
a course about information theory so I might use the module to add a compression layer
to compress ASCII data using fixed length block codes and see how that impacts
overall performance.
