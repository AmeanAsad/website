## About Project

I started working on Thrift at Hack The North 2019. This project is about optimizing how people can save 
money through a web application that connects with your bank information through an API.
Lets say you want to save `X` amount of money in `Y` amount of time. The web app analyzes your
spending habits, income streams, and priority payments in order to give you a close estimate of whether
it is possible or not to save that amount of money in the given time. If it is possible to save that 
money, the web application provides a monthly savings plan where it makes budget cuts on 
spending categories based on their priority. 


At the core, this project is a constrained optimization problem that can be solved using 
Linear Programming. Priority payments such as tuition, medicine, bills, etc. all act as constraints
that must be satisfied each month. Spending habits such as entertainment, take out, gifts, etc. are
all variable expenditures that can be optimized. The optimization problem can be stated as following:
Given a monthly income, what is the minimum amount of budget cuts that we can make to our 
spending habits such that we can save `X` amount of money in `Y` months and still afford
priority payments. 

## How the Project was Built:

As mentioned, the project was a web application. The main components of the project are:
- Django for Backend and Financial Analysis.
- React for Frontend.
- Bootstrap as a Component Library.
- PuLP as a Linear Programming Library. 
- TD's DaVinci API for bank customer data (no longer exists)

The main component that allowed this project to be possible was the availibility of 
TD's DaVinci API which included a database of 1 million + randomly generated customer data.
Unfortunately, the DaVinci API is no longer active, so a major portion of the web application
is no longer available.


Python was used to perform analysis to find reoccuring patterns in customer payments. Each customer
had a history of payments available and patterns in spending were established based on monthly spending. 
This analysis identified consistent income streams, priority payments, spending habits, and some 
estimate of miscellaneous payments. The longer the customer history, the more accurate the identified 
patterns were. The analysis also identified all the categories the customer makes expenditures on such 
as shopping, dining, sports, etc. 


Next was solving the constrained optimization problem. This was done using `PuLP`, a linear programming
library available in Python. Each user had the ability to insert some weighting on their spending 
habits (eg how much do you care about entertainment, take out, etc. ). These weightings impacted
the budget cuts in the sense that higher budget cuts are taken out of low weighted categories if 
possible. The Linear program then takes into account all the category spendings from the Financial
analysis, the category weightings, and reoccuring payments and outputs an answer. It can output
no possible if the income streams are not sufficient for the amount of money being saved. This
can be adjusted by adjusting the savings period, savings amount, or changing the weightings on 
the spending categories. Otherwise, it will output a monthly savings plan identifying the amount
of money that could be spent on each category, including miscellaneous payments. Of course, the 
output is an estimate so it gaurantees to get you close enough to that savings amount, but 
necessarily the exact amount. 

Finally was developing a front-end for all the calculations that are occuring. This was done
with Django + React. A REST API was developed in Django that calculated savings plans per 
user request on the client side. A dashboard was developed to represent the customer data
and output the tables that contain the saving plans for customers. Some parts of the 
dashboard are represented in the images bellow.
