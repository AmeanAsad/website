## About This Project
I started working on this project
when I was learning about Organizational Behavior (OB). Organizational Behavior is the academic 
study of how people interact within groups. Concepts from OB are primarily applied by companies and businesses
to try and optimize their operations. 
Historically, some companies have taken a lot of unethical actions that were legal
towards their employees to help themselves operate effectively. An example of this is companies 
forcing early retirement
and resignations from employees to cut down on costs like severance pay or termination pay. Thankfully, 
in some countries actions like that are now deemed illegal and there are laws that exist that 
protect employees. Optimization is right at the core of machine learning and machine learning 
is becoming a substantial part of analyzing business operations. This got me 
wondering how can companies use their employee data to optimize their operations. 
This project tackles the implications of integrating AI into organizations; how can it be used and
are there ethical concerns to doing so. 



## What I did:
I want to start by saying that I am not an expert on machine learning, business analytics, or data privacy laws.
I was just doing some trivial experimentation that barely scratches the surface of a vastly open ended question. 


I decided to place myself in the position of an organization that wants to run more effectively. I collected
a dataset that represents employee turnover. This dataset contains personal information about each employee
and identifies whether the employee has left the company or not. I fed the processed data to a machine learning model
and then looked for 

The core of this problem is data. Companies already have stored tons of data with regards to their employees.
Things like marital status, race, department, years working, health information, etc.
