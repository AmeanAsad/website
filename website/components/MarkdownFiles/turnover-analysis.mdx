## About This Project
This project tackles the implications of integrating AI into organizations; how can it be used, what are the ethical issues, 
and how can we avoid making unfair decisions using it as a tool. I started working on this project
when I was learning about Organizational Behavior (OB). Organizational Behavior is the academic 
study of how people interact within groups. Concepts from OB are primarily applied by companies and businesses
to try and operate more effectively. Historically, some companies have taken a lot of unethical actions
towards their employees to help themselves operate effectively that were legal. An example of this is companies 
forcing early retirement
and resignations from employees to cut down on costs like severance pay or termination pay. Thankfully, 
in some countries actions like that are now deemed illegal and there are laws that exist that 
protect employees.
