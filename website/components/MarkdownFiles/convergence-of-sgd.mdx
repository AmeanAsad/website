## About the Project

In 2020 I took a course on Optimization Theory taught by Professor Bahman Gharesifard.
The course gave a rigorous foundation on the field of optimization theory, introducing 
various types of derivatives, nessecary conditions of optimality, sufficient conditions
for optimality and defintions of convex functions and geometry. The course then used these optimization
tools to cover several topics including Hyperplane theorems, Fenchel Duality, and 
convergence proofs for machine learning algorithms.
