## About Project:

This project was inspired by a linear algebra class I took in university taught 
by Professor Abdol-Reza Mansouri. I really liked learning about the process 
of gaussian elimination so I decided to write a program that solves n by n linear
systems using gaussian elimination. The program does it in three steps:
- Creates an augmented matrix
- Derives the row-echelon form of the matrix.
- Solves the system using Gaussian elimination. 

One thing I have not considered are the edge cases of the possible inputs. 
I have not added checks to determine if the system has no solution or if the 
resultant augmented matrix will fail the process. 

I am probably not going to visit this code again. I wrote this as an exercise 
and there are good open source linear system solvers out there already.
