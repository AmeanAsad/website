It took me a few months to finish it, but I ended up creating a web application that does tracking and created a Python module that does disease spread simulations. By the time I finished in May, there were already tons of trackers out there, but my little website got a few thousand hits to it felt good to inform some people."

I worked on developing software features for the Watson Studio platform under the supervision of Lin Ju and Dejan Glozic. I owned one of their microservices where I overhauled a lot of the backend and worked regularly on fixing bugs and developing feature requests. I was also responsible for doing service integrations from other teams on Watson Studio. During my internship, I integrated 9 new services in Watson Studio. I worked on developing new pages and UI features for Watson Studio's new UI known as Projects 3.0. This included doing a lot front end development for the new UI and I created a reusable data panel module for my team. Additionally, I new foundations for bundle optimization and dependency sharing by adding Webpack 5 to my team's code base, introducing concepts such as code splitting, module fedaration, and treeshaking"
